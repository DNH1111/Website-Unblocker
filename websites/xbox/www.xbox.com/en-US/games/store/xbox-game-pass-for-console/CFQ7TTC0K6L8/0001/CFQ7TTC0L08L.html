Magic has returned to the world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Technology merges with flesh and consciousness. Elves, trolls, orks and dwarves walk among us, while ruthless corporations bleed the world dry. You are a shadowrunner - a mercenary living on the fringes of society, in the shadows of massive corporate arcologies, surviving day-by-day on skill and instinct alone. When the powerful or the desperate need a job done, you get it done... by any means necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city’s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed.\r\n\r\nThe unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation over 30 years ago. Return to the world of Shadowrun, with this cult-classic turn-based tactical RPG finally ported to consoles.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\nGripping Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With the variety of weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. A successful run requires commanding a team of runners with the right balance of combat, tech, and magical abilities.\r\n\r\nSkill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun Returns’ classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose. Want to start summoning spirits as an ork Shaman and evolve into a cybered-up weapon specialist? Do it!\r\n\r\nEngaging 2D\u002F3D Art Style: Shadowrun Returns mixes dynamic 3D characters and lighting with a vibrant, hand-painted environment.

The Director's Cut adds a host of new content and enhancements to the original game making it the definitive version on consoles of this one-of-a-kind cyberpunk RPG experience.\r\n\r\nMan Meets Magic & Machine\r\nIn 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall.\r\n\r\nIt’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday.\r\n\r\nNow, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return…\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\nA Classic, Story-Driven cRPG adapted to consoles: Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart, 20+ hour campaign with a diverse cast of all-too-human characters.\r\n\r\nA One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting: Experience the unique “Tech meets Magic” dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting. Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into.\r\n\r\nCommand Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But it’s not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in.\r\n\r\nGripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices.\r\n\r\nSkill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun: Dragonfall’s classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose.\r\n\r\nUpdated\u002FRedesigned UI: To better experience this cult-classic on consoles, the UI has been redesigned to meet the needs of console players! \r\n","developerName":"Harebrained Schemes, Codeglue","hasAddOns":false,"images":{"boxArt":{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fstore-images.s-microsoft.com\u002Fimage\u002Fapps.13822.14266045593708116.bcec8af8-9570-471e-aa75-827739f252f6.a3f2fd69-c499-4cb1-9860-59c5d1d91518","width":2160,"height":2160},"poster":{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fstore-images.s-microsoft.com\u002Fimage\u002Fapps.29887.14266045593708116.bcec8af8-9570-471e-aa75-827739f252f6.49d3a420-93ce-477d-baa8-2d2af1322bb9","width":1440,"height":2160},"superHeroArt":{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fstore-images.s-microsoft.com\u002Fimage\u002Fapps.27671.14266045593708116.f6624cf3-4372-4621-81b9-875cd02d9c6f.b2a97150-68d6-4e16-b59a-15c696c6f29b","width":3840,"height":2160}},"includedWithPassesProductIds":[],"maxInstallSize":0,"optimalSkuId":"0017","preferredSkuId":"0010","productFamily":"Games","productId":"9PKJTP6DTND3","productKind":"Game","publisherName":"Paradox Interactive","ratingCount":0,"releaseDate":"2022-06-21T16:00:00.0000000Z","shortDescription":"Harebrained Schemes' biggest Shadowrun game to date, and the definitive Shadowrun RPG experience available on consoles.

Fight your way across the most immersive maps yet, with many real-world locations captured in stunning detail, and an improved traversal system that lets you explore more of them than ever before.\r\nFrance, 1944 – As part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, elite marksman Karl Fairburne makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken.\r\n\r\nEXPANSIVE CAMPAIGN\r\nMany real-world locations have been captured using photogrammetry to recreate a living, immersive environment, and multiple infiltration and extraction points and kill list targets provide a whole new perspective on each mission. Take on the Nazi plot solo or work with a partner, with improved co-op mechanics allowing you to share ammo and items, give orders and heal each other.\r\n\r\nADVANCED GUNPLAY PHYSICS AND TRAVERSAL\r\nUse ziplines, slide down slopes and shimmy along ledges to reach the perfect vantage point, or to sneak past a sharp-eyed lookout. Factor in rifle stock and barrel options along with gravity, wind and heart rate while you line up your sights on the target.\r\n\r\nHIGH CALIBRE CUSTOMISATION\r\nUse workbenches to customise and upgrade virtually every aspect of your weapon – change scopes, stocks, barrels, magazines and more. Rifles, secondaries and pistols all have a huge variety of options. On top of that you can select the ammo to suit your target, from armour-piercing right down to non-lethal.\r\n\r\nINVASION MODE – CAMPAIGN DROP IN PvP AND CO-OP\r\nInvade another player’s Campaign as an Axis sniper and engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse, providing a new dimension to the challenge as you stalk your prey. Alternatively, as Karl you can call for assistance and have a second sniper drop in to help you out of a tricky situation.\r\n\r\nTENSE ADVERSIAL MULTIPLAYER\r\nCustomise your character and loadout and earn XP, medals and ribbons as you take on intensely competitive 16 player battles that will really test your sharpshooting skills.

The Microsoft Flight Simulator Standard Game of the Year Edition includes 25 highly detailed planes with unique flight models and 38 hand-crafted airports.\r\n\r\nThis enhanced edition introduces simmers to five all-new aircraft, eight new handcrafted airports, six new Discovery Flights, new tutorials, and updates to the weather system\r\n\r\nThe five new handcrafted aircraft in Microsoft Flight Simulator include:\r\n• Boeing F\u002FA-18 Super Hornet: Our first military jet and a highly requested feature from the community. The Top Gun: Maverick expansion will release with the movie next Spring, but we wanted simmers to have the opportunity to test their need for speed this holiday.\r\n• VoloCity: We partnered with well-known German company Volocopter, which is working on an eVTOL called “VoloCity”, a vision for an urban air taxi. We worked closely with the Volocopter engineering team to develop an authentic version of the prototype aircraft for the simulator. This is our first aircraft that can perform pinpoint landings and is a teaser of what you can look forward to in 2022 when we intend to launch helicopters in the sim.\r\n• Pilatus PC-6 Porter: This legendary short takeoff and landing (STOL) utility aircraft is a highly versatile plane from Switzerland and comes with several cockpits, cabins, and landing gear variations.

Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! \r\n\r\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED & RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\r\nOver 50 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment.  Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator & prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\r\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day\u002Fnight cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\r\n\r\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\r\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\r\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS\r\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\r\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\r\n\r\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\r\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave. Special themed events will occur in the world with corresponding limited-run items!","developerName":"Studio Wildcard","hasAddOns":true,"images":{"boxArt":{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fstore-images.s-microsoft.com\u002Fimage\u002Fapps.18165.67854144654891351.62e8ac86-d08d-4b3e-a943-500d5e0b2692.48abdadc-4b45-42b4-9119-5183a2c2b3ff","width":1080,"height":1080},"poster":{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fstore-images.s-microsoft.com\u002Fimage\u002Fapps.59714.67854144654891351.62e8ac86-d08d-4b3e-a943-500d5e0b2692.84297a79-9d0e-4de5-85b0-e08169607845","width":720,"height":1080},"superHeroArt":{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fstore-images.s-microsoft.com\u002Fimage\u002Fapps.44561.67854144654891351.62e8ac86-d08d-4b3e-a943-500d5e0b2692.7c8422ad-1ebc-47b3-950c-a8fa0e652860","width":1920,"height":1080}},"includedWithPassesProductIds":[],"maxInstallSize":0,"optimalSkuId":"0001","preferredSkuId":"0001","productFamily":"Games","productId":"BNBLC4ZGFNKB","productKind":"Game","publisherName":"Studio Wildcard","ratingCount":2006,"releaseDate":"2017-08-29T00:00:00.0000000Z","shortDescription":"Stranded naked, freezing & starving on a mysterious island, you must hunt, harvest, craft items, grow crops, & build shelters to survive.

Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading screens, and no limits. In this infinite procedurally generated universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again.\r\n\r\nEmbark on an epic voyage\r\nAt the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos. But, facing hostile creatures and fierce pirates, you'll know that death comes at a cost, and survival will be down to the choices you make over how you upgrade your ship, your weapon and suit.\r\n\r\nFind your own destiny\r\nYour voyage through No Man's Sky is up to you. Will you be a fighter, preying on the weak and taking their riches, or taking out pirates for their bounties? Power is yours if you upgrade your ship for speed and weaponry.\r\nOr a trader? Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge rewards.\r\nOr perhaps an explorer? Go beyond the known frontier and discover places and things that no one has ever seen before. Upgrade your engines to jump ever farther, and strengthen your suit for survival in toxic environments that would kill the unwary.\r\n\r\nShare your journey\r\nThe galaxy is a living, breathing place. Trade convoys travel between stars, factions vie for territory, pirates hunt the unwary, and the police are ever watching. Every other player lives in the same galaxy, and you can choose to share your discoveries with them on a map that spans known space.

In Astroneer you can:\r\n\r\n•Reshape the ground under your feet as though it were made of clay.\r\n•Survive on and explore carefully crafted planets that can be entirely deformed and traversed.\r\n•Snap together components and objects to build bases and vehicles.\r\n•Play with friends in 4 player online drop-in\u002Fdrop-out co-op.\r\n•Discover and uncover the mysteries of the solar system\r\n\r\n•••Deform & shape everything around you•••\r\nIn Astroneer, players use their deform tool to dig, collect, shape and build anything they wish. Use this ability to dig to the center of the planet, build a ramp into the sky, or make megaliths just by using terrain! \r\n\r\n•••Explore an entire solar system•••\r\nOur vast solar system includes 7 wondrous planets that players can travel between and explore every inch of, from the entire spherical surface, through treacherous layers of caves, all the way down to mysterious the core. Each of those planets has unique and challenging surface and cave biomes that offer a multitude of challenges for players on their journey.\r\n\r\n•••Customize & build on the fly••• \r\nItems that Astroneers craft and find in the world can be snapped and connected together to create unique creations for any situation. Customize and decorate your bases, vehicles, and Astroneer.\r\n\r\n•••4 Player co-op•••\r\nAstroneer is better with friends. Group up with other players and work together to create massive industrial bases or to create fun games in the extensive creative sandbox. \r\n\r\n•••Survive & harness the power of the planets•••\r\nOnce Astroneers are ready, they may choose to attempt to understand and possibly harness the power behind mysterious structures found in the world.\r\n\r\nAstroneer began as a Game Preview title and would not be here today if not for your support, feedback, and ideas throughout that process.

You’re not a hero. Thrust into unfortunate circumstances, you find yourself with no other option than to unravel what might be your biggest case yet. \r\n\r\nThere is no choice. We change, but we change nothing. Get to work, detective.  \r\n\r\nABOUT \r\n\r\nBackbone is a post-noir narrative adventure. Become raccoon private eye Howard Lotor and explore dystopian Vancouver inhabited by animals as you uncover a deeply personal story of change and transformation. \r\n\r\nBackbone is inspired by film noir, weird sci-fi, post-soviet aesthetics, modern political regimes, the works of Lynch and Kaufman, and existential philosophy of Sartre. It is a linear, cinematic narrative experience that subverts genre and challenges your perception of what it means to be a person. \r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY \r\n\r\nBackbone’s gameplay is focused on storytelling and emotional expression, featuring rich and elaborate dialogues inspired by old school CRPGs, as well as exploration of the lush environments. The end of all things is inevitable, but defining which version of Howard Lotor reaches the conclusion is up to you. \r\n\r\nAs Howard, you will: \r\n\r\n• Make meaningful connections with a diverse cast of characters in pursuit of truth \r\n• Shape and express your identity through dialogue choices - decide what kind of person you want to be \r\n• Explore and experience both downtrodden and flourishing districts of a strange, yet familiar version of Vancouver \r\n• Come to terms with the universal pain of existence and loss \r\n• Be a raccoon \r\n \r\nFEATURES \r\n\r\nPost-noir dystopia \r\n\r\nBackbone’s Vancouver is a dangerous place, bleak and dreary, but not entirely without hope. It’s a tale of a cold and uncaring world, interspersed with genuine connections and a bruised but undying drive to make a difference. Everyone wants to change the world, but not always for the better. \r\n\r\nStunning visuals \r\n\r\nThe breathtaking combination of high-resolution pixel art and 3D effects like dynamic lighting, pouring rain, volumetric fog and neon lights bring the sprawling City to life. Visit iconic Vancouver locations like Gastown, Granville and Fairmont Hotel, reimagined in a world now inhabited by anthropomorphic animals. \r\n\r\nEvocative and unforgettable soundtrack \r\n\r\nOriginal doom jazz soundtrack by Danshin and Arooj Aftab features an innovative combination of classic jazz and electronic music. Backbone’s OST is expertly crafted to create a cinematic, atmospheric, and simply jaw-dropping soundscape that serves and enhances storytelling.

In exchange for escape from the island, the students are forced to play a killing game and find the killer through class trials. Play through high-speed and fast-paced class trials by gathering testimony and evidence during investigations and use them as ammunition to shoot down your opponent's contradictory statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n■ Game Features\r\nDeadly Island Vibes: Murder is the only means of escape when you’re trapped on this island paradise. As your fellow classmates start dropping like coconuts, you’ll need to delve into each murderous incident, forage for clues, and interview your classmates to reveal the opportunity, motive, and means behind each killer case!\r\n\r\nTribal Council: You’ll go head-to-head in all new minigames with the other students during the Class Trial, shooting down their false truths and using your evidence to uncover what really happened.

Alternatively, as Karl you can call for assistance and have a second sniper drop in to help you out of a tricky situation.\r\n\r\nTENSE ADVERSIAL MULTIPLAYER\r\nCustomise your character and loadout and earn XP, medals and ribbons as you take on intensely competitive 16 player battles that will really test your sharpshooting skills. If co-op’s more your style, you can team up with up to 3 other players against waves of enemies in Survival mode.\r\n\r\nENHANCED KILL CAM\r\nMore realistic and grisly than ever, the trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing you the true destructive power of each shot. Bones deflect bullets unpredictably, ripping a new path through enemy bodies. SMGs and pistols can also trigger kill cams, including multiple shots in dramatic slow motion.\r\n","skuId":"0011","skuImages":{},"skuTitle":"Sniper Elite 5"}},"BRL7GC0GP1BM":{"0001":{"isGamesWithGoldSku":false,"isPreorder":false,"optimalAvailabilityId":"9RK4VC46FDLX","preferredAvailabilityId":"9RK4VC46FDLX","productId":"BRL7GC0GP1BM","skuDescription":"Set in a brutally unforgiving post-apocalyptic world overrun by the undead, 7 Days to Die is an open-world game that is a unique combination of first person shooter, survival horror, tower defense, and role-playing games.

The Microsoft Flight Simulator Standard Game of the Year Edition includes 25 highly detailed planes with unique flight models and 38 hand-crafted airports.\r\n\r\nThis enhanced edition introduces simmers to five all-new aircraft, eight new handcrafted airports, six new Discovery Flights, new tutorials, and updates to the weather system\r\n\r\nThe five new handcrafted aircraft in Microsoft Flight Simulator include:\r\n• Boeing F\u002FA-18 Super Hornet: Our first military jet and a highly requested feature from the community. The Top Gun: Maverick expansion will release with the movie next Spring, but we wanted simmers to have the opportunity to test their need for speed this holiday.\r\n• VoloCity: We partnered with well-known German company Volocopter, which is working on an eVTOL called “VoloCity”, a vision for an urban air taxi. We worked closely with the Volocopter engineering team to develop an authentic version of the prototype aircraft for the simulator. This is our first aircraft that can perform pinpoint landings and is a teaser of what you can look forward to in 2022 when we intend to launch helicopters in the sim.\r\n• Pilatus PC-6 Porter: This legendary short takeoff and landing (STOL) utility aircraft is a highly versatile plane from Switzerland and comes with several cockpits, cabins, and landing gear variations. It is the result of our close collaboration with the manufacturer and the development efforts by famed developers Hans Hartmann and Alexander Metzger resulted in a great and fun new aircraft with exception capabilities in the simulator.\r\n• CubCrafters NX Cub: Yakima-based CubCrafters recently introduced a nosewheel option for their flagship CC-19 XCub Aircraft, popularly called the NX Cub, which we are pleased to introduce to the flight sim audience to further enhance our bush flying and off airport options.\r\n• Aviat Pitts Special S1S: One of our most popular planes gets a single-seat option with the release of this aircraft.\r\n\r\nNew Airports - We are adding eight handcrafted airports in Central Europe and the United States:\r\n• Germany\r\n     o Leipzig\u002FHalle Airport (EDDP)\r\n     o Allgäu Airport Memmingen (EDJA)\r\n     o Kassel Airport (EDVK)\r\n•Switzerland\r\n     o Lugano Airport (LSZA)\r\n     o Zurich Airport (LSZH)\r\n     o Luzern-Beromunster Airport (LSZO)\r\n•United States\r\n     o Patrick Space Force Base (KCOF)\r\n     o Marine Corps Air Station Miramar (KNKX)\r\n\r\nThe Game of the Year release is adding information about 545 previously missing airports in the United States.\r\n\r\nNew Missions -Based on the popularity of the recently introduced Discovery Flights, we are adding an additional six locations (Helsinki, Freiburg im Breisgau, Mecca, Monument Valley, Singapore, and Mount Cook) to this popular series.\r\n\r\nNew Tutorials - To further expand the onboarding experience, we are adding 14 new tutorials, introducing simmers to Bush flying (in an Icon A5) and IFR (in a Cessna 172).\r\n\r\nNew Features - We are also pleased to introduce several highly requested features by the community: an updated weather system, early access to DX12, and a dev mode replay system.\r\n\r\nNew Photogrammetry Cities - As part of our ongoing collaboration with Bing Maps, we are pleased to add a number of new photogrammetry cities: Helsinki (Finland), Freiburg im Breisgau (Germany), Brighton, Derby, Eastbourne, Newcastle, and Nottingham (UK) and Utrecht (Netherlands).\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator Standard Game of the Year Edition will be available as a free update for owners on PC and Xbox Series X|S. For new users, the GOTY Standard Edition is the perfect entry point to flight simming as it offers an even richer experience, and it will be the item they purchase as we are retiring the original.

Rather than typical academic fare, students in Two Point County enjoy a range of wild and wonderful courses: from Knight School (hey, we all have to learn jousting at some point in our lives), to the salivatory Gastronomy, where your students will build mouth-watering concoctions like giant pizzas and enormous pies.
